Soon:
- write models (with and without mh query), see what's used, start writing style guide, add req features to probjs
- look through js specification, decide which individual features are useful/recommended/problematic, add to style guide
- add xrps, maybe mem
- forward-model & laziness: intermediate representation s.t. graphics rendering can incrementally pull?
  "infinite zoom", different levels of detail, coarse-fine

Eventually:
- reduce stack trace overhead
- implement RJMCMC
